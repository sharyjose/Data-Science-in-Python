# Data-Science-in-Python
This includes the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. This will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with the knowledge of using functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. This enables me to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses. 

# Fundamentals of Data Manipulation with Python

## Objectives
Load, manipulate, and select data using numpy, as well as understand the fundamental data types in the numpy ecosystem,
Show the benefits of vectorization with numpy data,
Apply regular expressions to string data and
Demonstrate, at a high level, how regular expression pattern matching is expressed

# Basic Data Processing with Pandas

## Objectives
Demonstrate how the series class builds on top of numpy datatypes,
Remember that the series class is a numpy array,
Demonstrate the basics of how to query a series structure,
Remember the dataframe as the principle data science structure,
Define the various features of a dataframe,
Demonstrate what an axis is in relation to dataframes,
Demonstrate the difference between the series and dataframe classes,

## objective
Create and use pandas DataFrames to represent raw data

# Answering Questions with Messy Data

## Objective
Demonstrate basic statistical test knowledge on dataframes in pandas and
Recognize other kinds of structured data such as networks, graphs, natural language
