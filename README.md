# Data-Science-in-Python
This includes the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. This will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with the knowledge of using functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. This enables me to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.
